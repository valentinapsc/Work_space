    <h1>The Book of Programming</h1>

    <p>This website contains fragments from the Book of Programming, 
    an ancient tome lost to time.</p>

    <p>The book is said to have been written by a disciple of Fu-Tzu,
    the legendary master programmer.</p>
    
    <p>Currently, two sections have been recovered:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a section describing the two aspects of programming (data and control);</li>
        <li>a section reporting short-sayings and other wisdom of the master Fu-Tzu.</li>
    </ul>
