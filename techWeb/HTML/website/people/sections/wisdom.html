    <p>A student was complaining about digital numbers. 'When I take the root
        of two and then square it again, the result is already inaccurate!'.
        Overhearing him, Fu-Tzu laughed, and said 'Here is a sheet of paper. Write down
        the precise value of the square root of two for me'.

        Fu-Tzu said 'When you cut against the grain of the wood, much strength
        is needed. When you program against the grain of a problem, much code
        is needed.'

        Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were boasting about the size of their latest
        programs. 'Two-hundred thousand lines', said Tzu-li, 'not counting
        comments!'. 'Psah', said Tzu-ssu, 'mine is almost a MILLION lines
        already.' Fu-Tzu said 'My best program has five hundred lines.'
        Hearing this, Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were enlightened.

        A student had been sitting motionless behind his computer for hours,
        frowning darkly. He was trying to write a beautiful solution to a
        difficult problem, but could not find the right approach. Fu-Tzu hit
        him on the back of his head and shouted 'Type something!'. The student
        started writing an ugly solution. After he had finished, he suddenly
        understood the beautiful solution.
