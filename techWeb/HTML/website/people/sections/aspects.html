    <h1>The Two Aspects</h1>
    <p>When the creators built the machine, they put in the processor and the
        memory. From these arise the two aspects of the program.
    </p>
    
        <p>The aspect of the processor is the active substance. It is calledd
        Control. The aspect of the memory is the passive substance. It is
        called Data.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Data is made of merely bits, yet it takes complex forms. Control
        consists only of simple instructions, yet it performs difficult
        tasks. From the small and trivial, the large and complex arise.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        The program source is Data. Control arises from it. The Control
        proceeds to create new Data. The one is born from the other, the
        other is useless without the one. This is the harmonious cycle of
        Data and Control.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Of themselves, Data and Control are without structure. The programmers
        of old moulded their programs out of this raw substance. Over time,
        the amorphous Data has crystallised into data types, and the chaotic
        Control was restricted into control structures and functions.
