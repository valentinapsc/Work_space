    <h1>Fu-Tzu: The Legendary Programmer</h1>
    <p>When the creators built the machine, they put in the processor and the
        memory. From these arise the two aspects of the program.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        With a long beard and robes adorned with clever coding jokes, 
        Fu-Tzu was a legend among programmers.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        It is said his first word was printf. 
        Some of his wisdom was trascribed in the Book of Programming.
